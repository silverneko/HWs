OS: openSUSE tumbleweed
Compiler: gcc 7.3.1

Execute "ulimit -s unlimited" first, so you don't get a stackoverflow later.
Execute "make" to compile and execute each problem.

The input images should be put in a subfolder "raw", so the folder tree
should look like this:

raw
├── sample1.raw
├── sample2.raw
└── sample3.raw

If the input files are located elsewhere, then the Makefile will need to be
manually edited to change the input file's path.

There are five source files:

  problem1a.cpp
  problem1b.cpp
  problem1c.cpp
  problem2a.cpp
  problem2b.cpp

which correspond to the five different subproblems (exclude the
bonus problem).
The programs' usages are:

./problem1a raw/sample1.raw B.raw
./problem1b raw/sample1.raw C.raw
./problem1c raw/sample1.raw S.raw
./problem2a raw/sample2.raw K.raw
./problem2b raw/sample2.raw K.raw E.raw

Additionally, one of problem2b's input must be problem2a's output.
