OS: openSUSE tumbleweed
Compiler: gcc 7.3.1

Execute "ulimit -s unlimited" before you compile.
Execute "make" to compile and execute each problem.

The three input images should be put in a subfolder "raw", so the folder tree
should look like:

raw
├── sample1.raw
├── sample2.raw
├── sample3.raw
├── sample4.raw
└── sample5.raw

If the input files are located elsewhere, then the Makefile will need to be
manually edited to change the input file's path.

There is four source files: problem1a.cpp, problem1b.cpp, problem2a.cpp and
problem2b.cpp which correspond to the four different subproblems (exclude the
bonus problem).
The four programs' usages are:

./problem1a input.raw outputname
./problem1b input.raw outputname
./problem2a input.raw outputname
./problem2b problem2a.out.raw outputname

Additionally, problem2b's input must be problem2a's output.
Output files' names are automatically suffixed with the string ".raw".
