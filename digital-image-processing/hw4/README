OS: openSUSE tumbleweed
Compiler: gcc 7.3.1

Execute "ulimit -s unlimited" first, so you don't get a stackoverflow later.
Execute "make" to compile and execute each problem.

The input images should be put in a subfolder "raw", so the folder tree
should look like this:

raw
├── sample1.raw
├── sample2.raw
└── TrainingSet.raw

If the input files are located elsewhere, then the Makefile will need to be
manually edited to change the input file's path.

There are 2 source files:

  preprocess_trainingset.cpp
  ocr.cpp

The programs' usages are:

./preprocess_trainingset raw/TrainingSet.raw S.raw > model
./ocr model raw/sample1.raw
./ocr model raw/sample2.raw

./preprocess_trainingset preprocesses the TrainingSet (denoise / segmentation).
./ocr uses the preprocessed TrainingSet characters to predict CAPTCHA.
   Prediction results are printed to stdout.
